## Neural Networks and Deep Learning: Crash Course AI #3

### intro

<li>Image recognition was a big challenge in the AI industry.</li>
<li>A professor named Fei-Fei and a group of other machine learning reasearchers helped devlop an AI that could recognize images.</li>
<li>They created a huge public data set o real world photos so everyone could help using different algorithms.</li>

### Crowd SOurcing

<li>ImageNet implemented crowd sourcing to divide the work needed to manage the AI because it would take way too long for one person to do it all</li>
<li>In 2012 Alexnet innovated AI algorithms by using neural networks.</li>

### Neural Networks

<li>Neural networks have an input layer, 1 or multiple hidden layers and an ouput layer.</li>
<li>all the neurons send data to the hidden layers and they check for certain components, that gets translated into a number, and then ouputs everything into an answer.</li>
<li>They key to neural networks and all AI is math.</li>
<li>each neuron can check part of a picture and see if the shape fits for example a dog and then send it to the next neuron that also complied other parts of the icture for the same and thats how ai can guess if a picture resembles a dog.</li>

### Deep Learning

<li>More hidden layers means more math which translates to more computing power.</li>
<li>Neural networks are used to detect and prevent fraud, cancer researh, alexa devices, and social media.</li>

## Boolean Logic & Logic Gates: Crash Course Computer Science #3

### Intro

<li>We can represent binary with two states of electricity or true and false.</li>
<li>Binary and true and false go hand in hand.</li>

### Quinary System

<li>5 states of electricity is what quinary system stands for.</li>
<li>Binary was used to represent boolean Algebra which came from george boole a self taught english mathmatician.</li>
<li>Boolean algebra uses true and false but also not, and and an or operation.</li>


### And Gate

<li>not flips the input as the output</li>
<li>and operation takes to inputs but only has one output</li>
<li>this has a combination of 4 outputs where the only true output is when both inputs are true.</li>

### OR Gate

<li>An OR Gate can give and input that's either or</li>

### BOOLEAN Logic Table For Exclusive OR

<li>Exclusive or XOR means that if both inputs are true the output is false, but also if both inputs are false the output is still false. A mismatched input is still false.</li>
<li></li>

### BOOLEAN Logic Table For XOR

<li>The table for both OR and XOR operators are almost identical except that for XOR even when both inputs are true the output is false.</li>
<li>XOR is a very useful component in the programming world.</li>
<li>logic gates are used at a proffesional level to design processors</li>
<li>Logic statements can be made with these operators.</li>

## Programming Basics: Statements & Functions: Crash Course Computer Science #12

### Intro

### Programming languages

<li>Have statements and by using them we can code and communicate with a machine.</li>
<li>Syntax is the language that programming languages use when it comes to coding</li>

### Assignment statement

<li>Is the process of assigning variables like words and numbers to make statements.</li>
<li>We can call variables whatever we want as long as they dont overlap.</li>
<li>The syntax is there to let other people know how your code is written</li>
<li>Writing a computer program is like writing a recipe, it has steps that must be done to het a desired outcome</li>
<li>We can use control flow statements to set conditions. They are written if, then, end if. You can also add an else.</li>
<li>You can make a conditional statement to repeat a process by using a while loop.</li>
<li>For loop is count controlled and repeats a specific number of times.</li>
<li>less is more when it comes to coding.</li>

### Subroutines

<li>Subroutines are called Functions or methods.</li>
<li>A function can be used by any part of a program by calling its name.</li>

### Return Statements

<li>We use return statements to call back functions.</li>
<li>functions can simplify programming and not make code look bloated.</li>
<li>Software consists of thousands of smaller functions all each responsible for different things and feautures.</li>

### Libraries

<li>Modern programming languages come with huge bundles of pre-written functions </li>
<li>There are libraries for almost anything including networking, graphics and sounds.</li>
<li>This video was a great way for me to further understanding bootstrap and how use use the bundles to create websites.</li>
