# About CIT82 Intro To Web Dev.
Week 1
## About Git vs Github.

We learned the difference between Git and GitHub. We are going to use git to manage our code, while we use GitHub to store and host our code.

## Discuss Web Certificate and Degree.

We were showed that you can strive for a web developer degree, or a web developer certificate for fewer credits. I was initially taking these classes with the certificate in mind, but now that Ms. Waller has clarified the paths. I realized I was put on the degree path, when I talked to a counselor. And I will stick with it, Thank you for clarifying.

## More About the course.

We now know how we receive assignments, when to turn them in, where and when due dates for assignments are, and how a textbook is not required for the class. We also saw that the content we will be learning and consuming for this class will be curated and or personally produced by Ms. Waller. We were also informed that we can submit late work, with a 25% deduction.

## How to Submit our work.

And lastly we were showed how to submit our GitHub links to get a grade on our work or lectures. Also showing everyone where to find comments from teachers was helpful as I missed it when I first started online classes. Thankfully email notifications also help.
