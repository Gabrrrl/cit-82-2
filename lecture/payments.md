# What is a payment gateway? and how does it work?
<li>A payment gateway is a software application that payment service providers use to process payments for online purchases.</li>
<li>A gateway can be used for many types of payment methods, but this video focuses on credit cards.</li>
<li>The gateway encrypts sensitive details to ensure that information is passed safely between a customer, a store and the bank.</li>
<li>When someone buys something online a gateway opens to process the transaction by checking out and inputting their details.</li>
<li>The card and transaction details are stored in a secured servers and then forwarded to the bank for approval and then back to the merchant and finally back to the customer to be informed that the transaction ha been completed.</li>
<li>This whole process takes about 3 seconds.</li>
<li>A payment gateway is the most common way to connect to a payment system, only large merchants can connect to a bank directly.</li>
<li>The payment gateway fees are small compared to the advantage they offer managing businesses and controlling the risks associated with online payments.</li>
<li>A good payment gateway has customizable reporting options</li>
<li>A good payment gateway is able to process many different payment methods that may not be offered by the store</li>
