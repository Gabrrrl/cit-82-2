# What is the cloud?

## Before Cloud Computing

<li>You had to buy a stack of servers.</li>
<li>You had to mantain your own servers and expand when you had more traffic.</li>

## Disadvantages

<li>setting up your own servers costs a lot of money.</li>
<li>You had to troubleshoot your own business servers.</li>
<li>Traffic of servers might vary, it can be high or idle at times so you never knew when and how many servers you needed.</li>

# Uses for the cloud

## Why use the cloud?

<li>We use the cloud to host files from files, music, e-books, videos, apps and podcasts.</li>

## What is the cloud

<li>Your local system has limited space, the cloud helps by renting unlimited space for all our needs and apps we need to use..</li>

## What is cloud computing?

<li>Cloud computing let's you store data/applications on remote servers.</li>
<li>Allow you to process data/apps from servers.</li>
<li>allow you to access data/apps via the internet anywhere in the world.</li>

# Service Models

## Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service)

<li>Provides computing resources over the internet.</li>
<li>No worries about underlying machine.</li>
<li>Abstract the user from the physical machine.</li>
<li>The consumer can access data, apps, runtime, middleware and O/S.</li>
<li>the vendor is in charge of virtualization, servers, storage and networking.</li>

## Paas (Platform as a service)

<li>No control over the underlying architechture including OS, storage, servers, etc.</li>
<li>The cloud provider gives the ability to the customer to deploy customer created apps using programming languages, tools, etc. Which are provided by the cloud provider.</li>
<li>The consumer can access data and applications.</li>
<li>the vendor is in charge of runtime, middleware, O/s, virtualization, servers, storage and networking.</li>


## Saas (Software as a service)

<li>cloud provider leases applications or softwares which are owned by them to a client.</li>
<li>The consumer is in charge of data.</li>
<li>the vendor is in charge of apps, runtime, middleware, O/s, virtualization, servers, storage and networking.</li>

# Deployment Models

## Public Cloud

<li>A service provider makes resources, such as apps and storage available to the genral public over the internet.</li>
<li>Easy and inexpensive to set-up because hardware, apps and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.</li>
<li>No wasted resources because you pay for what you use.</li>

## Private cloud

<li>Offers hosted services for a limited number of people behind a firewall so it minimizes the security concerns.</li>
<li>Private cloud gives companies direct control over their data.</li>

## Hybrid Cloud

<li>A hybrid computing environment which uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third-party public cloud services.</li>
<li>It helps you leverage the best of both worlds.</li>

# Cloud providers

## Google Cloud Platform

<li>A very good cloud product because of their infrastructure and data they have available.</li>
<li>Also the cheapest cloud services in the market, because it relies on how much power you use to determine a price to charge.</li>

## DigitalOcean

## IBM Cloud

## Terremark

## Microsoft Azure

<li>Is the second biggest service provider in terms of the cloud market.</li>

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

<li>Is highly popular and has the most users and compute capacity.</li>
<li>Global leader Started before others in offering services.</li>

# Cloud Demos: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure

## Amazon web services

<li>Has a free tier that let's you use most free services to get used to the user interface and all the things they offer on their service.</li>
<li>You can be charged if you go over the free restrictions.</li>
<li>Creating instances id how you can acces a computer through the cloud.</li>
<li>There are many ways to customize your instance.</li>
<li>Key pair is a verification process, windows is an external login, linux is used for secured keys to use on servers.</li>

## Google Cloud

<li>charges on a time used basis compared to amazons instance basis.</li>
<li>Leaving processes open by accident can cause you to be accidentaly charged.</li>
