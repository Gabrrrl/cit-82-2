- The internet started with the arpanet in 1969 as a military project to connect a few unerversities.
- Throuought the 70's and 80's the Arpanet community kept growing.
- Arpanet was not good for sharing files like academic papers until the world wide web came to life.
- Google servers, html, css and javascript all work together to make the world wide web accessible to everyone.
- Tim Berners-Lee created the first browser and the first server, he also created the first website.
- He's the reason we're able to create websites as easily as we do now because we all agreed to use the same languages to process information.

# HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Websites use HTML as a way to write text on websites, and hyperlinks to link pages together.
- In 1995 and 1996 JavaScript and CSS came to the tech world, and changed the way we see and interact with websites.
- HTML describes hoe a website shouls be arranged while CSS adds style or flair to the website.
- Javascript makes the website interactive, we can add drop down menus, alerts, etc.

# Developer Fundamentals

- All browsers have to agree on how to read HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep compatibility stable.
- Always double check file readability between browsers, and screens.
# Developer History
- Applications in the early 2000's were written in JQuery because it allowed JavaScript to be written in a simple clean way.
- JQuery is outdated now.
- in the past Front end developer entailed HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. While Back end developer entailed PhP files for logic, Apache server for load times on files, and My SQL for databases.
- Languages come and go so always learn languages in demand.
- Now being a front end developer entails HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React. While back end Developer entails a Node server to manage load times and files, Node.Js and Express.Js for logic, and PostgreSQL & MongoBD for databases.
- The new way of coding websites is faster, cleaner and less prone to bugs than before.
